Dataset Structure
We simulate transactional sales data:

CustomerID	InvoiceDate	InvoiceNo	Quantity	Price
1001	       2023-03-05	  INV001	   2	      150
1002	       2023-03-07	  INV002	   1	      700
1003	       2023-03-10	  INV003	   3	      100
...	...	...	...	...

From this, weâ€™ll calculate:

Recency: How recently a customer purchased

Frequency: How often a customer purchased

Monetary: How much money the customer spent
